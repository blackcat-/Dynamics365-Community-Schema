<p>Dynamics 365 is coming, and it is an exciting time as it will allow businesses to implement powerful and adaptable applications with minimal development costs, allowing for a more natural inseparability between Microsoft Dynamics CRM, AX, Project Maderia, Office 365, Power Apps and Flow. To know more about Dynamics 365, check the video out here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYIPXx9zjj8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYIPXx9zjj8</a></p>

<p>The challenge is that within implementations, depending on the industry, there are often different customisations required as they store and use different data. This can be time consuming for an implementation and also challenging to create, however with the introduction of Dynamics 365 and the Common Data Model that it will use, there cannot be a better time.</p>

<p>The aim is, initially utilising the Dynamics CRM out of the box schema for the Account and Contact entities, we would then work together on an open source schema for these record types that would then ultimately feed into the Common Data Model in Dynamics 365. The Schemas are intended to focus on data that is critical to the operation of the types of records across the world, and not just for local environments, so it is important that multiple different languages and industries are taken into consideration.</p>

<p>When an organisation takes on a Microsoft Dynamics CRM Project, they  often customise  these elements and that takes thought and effort. This project aims to reduce that effort so that organisations can simply import this Schema and not require the work associated to defining these record types. The intention is for it to grow well beyond the Account and Contact records. </p>

<a id="how-will-this-work" class="anchor" href="#how-will-this-work" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How will this work?</h3>

<p>The plan is that the solutions within CRM are broken into 'features' where then an organisation can adopt the schema's they need which will then combine to create their overall solution. </p>

<p>We need you! We need you to branch the main standard out of the box schema and put forward your ideas on what should be feature solutions to the overall Schema for the Account and Contact entities in Microsoft Dynamics CRM. </p>

<p>To get started, go to the main repository and branch, making your edits in CRM and then export the solution, retrieve the XML Schema for the solution which contains your Account and/or Contact and upload to Github.</p>

<a id="in-association-with-crmug" class="anchor" href="#in-association-with-crmug" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In association with CRMUG</h3>

<p>The drive for this project is the collaborative aspects and CRMUG is a fantastic platform and community to introduce to this to. CRMUG operate globally, but specifically in Europe this is going to be focused as a 8 month event where CRMUG Europe Chapters discuss and collaborate to get as many ideas and as much input as possible. </p>

<h3>
<a id="first-release" class="anchor" href="#first-release" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First Release</h3>

<p>At the EMEA Summit, planned for April 2017, will feature a session which will introduce the first release based on the commit's people have completed over the past 8 months to create a 'first release' version of the Schemas. </p>

<h3>
<a id="and-after-that" class="anchor" href="#and-after-that" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>...and after that?</h3>

<p>As with all open source projects, anybody can work on the solution, but this project is intended to grow past the Account and Contact record type and also start working together into the Common Data Model of Dynamics 365.</p>
